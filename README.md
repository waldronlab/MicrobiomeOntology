# Microbiome Ontology

![.github/workflows/basic_checks.yaml](https://github.com/waldronlab/MicrobiomeOntology/workflows/.github/workflows/basic_checks.yaml/badge.svg)

This repository contains a working version of the Microbiome Ontology (MO). MO is a standardized language describing the human microbiome by its physiology, environment, dynamics and experimental associations. MO aims to harmonize taxon with associated physiologies to build machine-interpretable relations. Structured relationships between taxon and associated physiologies will allow for high-throughput downstrean analysis from microbiome studies. 

Ontologies are best when they repurpose and build upon other ontologies. MO will include terms from:
  * NCBITaxon
  * Ontology of Microbial Phenotypes
  * UBERON
  * Ontology of Host-Microbiome Interactions
  * Gene Ontology
  * Ontology of Biomedical Investigation
  
The MO will provide a physiological characterization of individual taxa associated with the human microbiome. For example, the genus of Lactobacillus can be characterized as an Gram positive, rod shaped, anaerobes that produce lactic acid. They are largely found in oral cavities, gastrointestinal tracts (GIT), and vaginas. Therefore, the MO will include the following characterization.

  * Cell wall composition (Gram stain)
  * Shape
  * Respiration type
  * Environmental location/s
  * General Metabolism class?
  * Size 
  
Ideally, the Microbiome Ontology will provide information about the niche of microbes. Identifying microbes by physiological traits instead of merely taxa will provide new insight into understanding the microbial organ.
