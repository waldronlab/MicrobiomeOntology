# Microbiome Ontology

![.github/workflows/basic_checks.yaml](https://github.com/waldronlab/MicrobiomeOntology/workflows/.github/workflows/basic_checks.yaml/badge.svg)

This repository contains a working version of the Microbiome Ontology (MO). MO is a standardized language describing the human microbiome by its physiology, environment, dynamics and experimental associations. MO aims to harmonize taxon with associated physiologies to build machine-interpretable relations. Structured relationships between taxon and associated physiologies will allow for high-throughput downstrean analysis from microbiome studies. 

Ontologies are best when they repurpose and build upon other ontologies. MO will include terms from:
  * NCBITaxon
  * Ontology of Microbial Phenotypes
  * UBERON
  * Ontology of Host-Microbiome Interactions
  * Gene Ontology
  * Ontology of Biomedical Investigation
