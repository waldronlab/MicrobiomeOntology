Purpose
The purpose of this document is to keep my thoughts and notes while building a microbiome ontology (MO). My goal is to create an ontology used for downstream analysis of microbiome data. A Microbiome Ontology builds a knowledge system for computational modelling of biological systems, which will range from molecular functions to organisms. The key feature is the automated reasoning.

What do I want the microbiome ontology (MO) to be?

We want the ontology used for analysis of microbiome data. First, I made a term list to describe microbiomes, bacterial communities, and bacterial physiology. 

*Size
Volume
Surface area

*Metabolic uptake mechanisms
Iron
Small molecules (expand)
Secreted 

*Shape
Rod
Spiral
Spirochete
Circular, coccus
Filamentous
Mycobacteria 
Spores
Curved rods (vibrio, caulobacter)
Rod-coccus
Corynebacteria (club)
Spirella

*Arrangements
Diplo
Staph
Strep
Tetrads
Sarcinae (cube)

*Biofilm forming conditions
Time to assemble
Biofilm size
Transitional states

*Environments
Aquatic
Terrestrial
Host-engaged
Mucous
Epithelial
Airborne
Oxygen consumption 
Anaerobic
Facultative Anaerobic
Aerobic
pH
Temperature
Salinity



Describe human living
Household
Domestic animals (pets)
Family
Non-family
Roommates
Dormitory

*Extracellular filaments
Flagellum 
Pili, various
Slime

Secretion systems
Type 1 - 9 (Gram-negative)
Gram positive
Mycobacterium


Secondly, I looked at microbiome datasets and got a better sense of the type of data and analysis available.

Population
Sample
Differential population abundance
Diversity
Presence 
Absence
Metabolic function
Stains
Case 
Controls
Statistical testing (expand)
Protein secretion
Twin study
16S
Metagenomic
Pathway Abundance
Enriched
Gene Set Enrichment analysis


Learn language on data modeling like: what is the difference between an Identity vs attribute? Sean said that the relationship between attributes shouldn't carry information. Ask him to give an example.
